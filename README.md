# DCGAN_AnimeFaceGenerator
The DCGAN Anime Face Generator is a deep learning project that utilizes a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic anime-style faces from random noise. Trained on a dataset of anime faces, the model consists of a generator and a discriminator that work together to create high-quality synthetic images. Each generated face is unique, as the model samples from a latent space to produce diverse outputs.

This project includes a simple and interactive web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to generate new anime faces with just a button click. The generator model is pre-trained, enabling quick inference without the need for additional training.
